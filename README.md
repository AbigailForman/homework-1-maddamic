# Homework 1

Some of these problems are taken from the end of Chapter 2 in the book, others are of my own design. Complete them to the best of your ability and then submit them. Make sure your code works (compiles, runs, and passes the initial checks) before you submit it. You can always resubmit up until the deadline, but it doesn't make sense to submit something that you know doesn't work.
